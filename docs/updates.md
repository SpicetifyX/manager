# Updates

## Automatic Updates

If "Check for Updates on Launch" is enabled in Settings, SpicetifyX Manager will check for a new version each time the app starts. If an update is available, it will be downloaded and applied automatically. No action is required.

This setting can be toggled at any time from the Settings page.

## Manual Updates

If automatic updates are disabled, a button will appear in the Settings page when a new version is available. Clicking it will download and apply the update using the same process as automatic updates.

Your settings, themes, extensions, and apps are not affected by updating the manager.

## Updating Spicetify

SpicetifyX Manager manages its own copy of the Spicetify CLI, stored at `~/.spicetifyx/`. Updates to the Spicetify CLI itself are handled separately from the manager and are not currently automated. A dedicated update flow for the CLI is planned for a future release.
