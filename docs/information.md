# Information

## What is SpicetifyX Manager?

SpicetifyX Manager is a desktop application for installing and managing [Spicetify](https://spicetify.app), a command-line tool that patches the Spotify desktop client to support custom themes, extensions, and apps.

The manager removes the need to interact with the command line entirely. It handles the full install process, provides a library view of your installed themes and extensions, gives access to a community marketplace, and lets you restore your Spotify client at any time.

## Features

**Dashboard**

An overview of your Spicetify installation. Shows the status of your Spotify and Spicetify installations, installed extension and app counts, and quick navigation to each section.

**Extensions**

Browse and manage your installed Spicetify extensions. Toggle extensions on or off, delete them, or install new ones from the marketplace. Changes are applied to Spotify automatically.

**Themes**

Browse and manage your installed Spicetify themes. Apply a theme, switch between color schemes, or delete themes you no longer use.

**Apps**

Browse and manage custom Spicetify apps. Toggle apps on or off or remove them from your installation.

**Marketplace**

Browse community-published extensions, themes, and apps directly from within the manager. Install any item with a single click.

**Settings**

- Discord Rich Presence: display your SpicetifyX activity on your Discord profile

- Check for updates on launch: automatically check for new SpicetifyX releases when the app starts
- Open Config Folder: open the Spicetify configuration directory directly
