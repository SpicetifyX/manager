# Installation

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or later, macOS, or Linux
- Spotify installed from [spotify.com](https://www.spotify.com/download). The Microsoft Store version is not supported.
- An internet connection for the initial setup

## Download

Download the latest release for your platform from the [releases page](https://github.com/SpicetifyX/manager/releases/tag/v0.0.1):

- **Windows:** SpicetifyX-Manager-Windows-0.0.1-Setup.exe
- **macOS:** SpicetifyX-Manager-macOS-0.0.1.dmg
- **Linux:** SpicetifyX-Manager-Linux-0.0.1.AppImage

All releases are available at [github.com/SpicetifyX/manager/releases](https://github.com/SpicetifyX/manager/releases).

## Install Steps

1. Download and run the installer for your platform
2. Follow the on-screen prompts to complete installation
3. Launch SpicetifyX Manager from your Start Menu, Applications folder, or app launcher
4. On first launch, the app will detect your Spotify installation and walk you through setting up Spicetify automatically

The setup process handles everything. It downloads the Spicetify CLI, configures the SpicetifyX theme, and patches your Spotify client. No manual command-line steps are required.

## Uninstall / Restore

To remove Spicetify and restore your Spotify client to its original state:

1. Open SpicetifyX Manager
2. Navigate to your Dashboard
3. Click the **Restore** button
4. Once complete, the app will close and Spotify will be restored

This removes all Spicetify files, extensions, themes, and configuration from your system.

To uninstall SpicetifyX Manager itself:

- **Windows:** Open Settings, go to Apps, search for "SpicetifyX Manager", and select Uninstall
- **macOS:** Drag SpicetifyX Manager from your Applications folder to the Trash
- **Linux:** Remove the AppImage file from wherever you placed it
